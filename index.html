              <h4>What is the Shipping Price Promise?</h4>
              <p>
                With regional distribution centers across the United States and more than 10,000 products in our portfolio, your materials are always within reach. Plus, no matter which location your order ships from, you’ll still only pay the shipping costs from your nearest distribution center. That’s our Shipping Price Promise: making sure you get the products you need and helping you stay on budget.  </p>
                 <h4>How will the Shipping Price Promise pricing appear on my invoice?</h4>

              <p>
                The Shipping Price Promise shipping charge will appear on your invoice as standard shipping. For orders with multiple items shipping separately, the shipping charge may be applied in portions to multiple statements, but it will always be your local shipping costs, regardless of where your products come from.
              </p>
   <h4>How do I get the Shipping Price Promise?</h4>
              <p>
                With our Shipping Price Promise, the local shipping charge is automatically generated on your invoice, even if we ship your item(s) from another distribution center.</p>
              <h4>Does the Shipping Price Promise apply to all types of orders?</h4>
              <p>The Shipping Price Promise applies to all orders except LTL shipments</p>
         <h4>How can I view shipping charges?</h4>
            <p>You can review and select shipping options on the “Shipping & Billing” page under the “Shipping Method” drop-down menu during checkout. You will be able to view the charge for each shipping option before submitting payment.</p>
              <h4>How do I add a new shipping address?</h4>
            <p>On the “Shipping & Billing” page, select “Add New Shipping Address” in the “Shipping Address” section at the top-left of the page. You will be redirected to the “Add a New Shipping Address” form on a new page. Fill in the form and hit the “Submit” button. Your new shipping address will save to your account for future orders. If you have more than one shipping address, you can select the one you need for your order from the “Shipping Address” drop-down menu</p>
              <h4>What if I have more than one shipping address?</h4>
            <p>You can add more than one shipping address. Simply select “Add New Shipping Address” in the “Shipping Address” section at the top-left of the page. Fill in the form and click “Submit.” Your new shipping address will save to your account for future orders.</p>
              <h4>Where will my order ship from?</h4>
            <p>You can see which warehouse your products will ship from on the final “Order Summary” page during checkout. Simply look under “Delivery Information” for warehouse location. Please keep in mind that different products may ship from different warehouses.</p>
              <h4>What is factored into shipping costs?</h4>
            <p>Shipping costs will vary, depending on your order and the shipping options you select at checkout. Now you can best meet your budget by shopping and comparing shipping options in the “Shipping & Billing” page during checkout.</p>
              <h4>How can I track my order?</h4>
            <p>After your order ships, you will receive an email with shipping details and tracking information if available.</p>
              <p>If you need help with email confirmations, reach out to us on Chat, call us at 1-800-786-1876, or use our contact form.</p>
              <h4>What is Trivantage’s return policy?</h4>
            <p>Most returns are honored up to 60 days from the invoice date. See our Return Policy for more information regarding our return policy.</p>
              <h4>Does Trivantage have a preferred carrier?</h4>
            <p>Our preferred carrier is UPS but you can also choose FedEx, USPS, Spee-Dee, or LTL/Truck at checkout. Compare costs between carriers at checkout to find the best price for you. You can also set your own personal default carrier.</p>
              <h4>When should I ship USPS?</h4>
            <p>While UPS is Trivantage's preferred carrier, we offer a range of shipping options to best fit our customer needs, including USPS.</p>
              <p>USPS is often a less expensive option (however, delivery can take longer than other ground carriers). If you're looking for a lower price on a shipment that you don't need right away, USPS is a great choice.</p>
              <p>Depending on your order, you can choose from the following service levels:</p>
              <ul class="bullets">
                 <li>Priority Mail Express: next day (if order is placed prior to carrier pickup)</li>
                 <li>Priority Mail: 2–4 business days</li>
                 <li>First Class Mail: 1–5 business days in the continental U.S. (packages weighing up to 13 oz.)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you select USPS, an estimated delivery date will be shown at checkout. As with UPS, a tracking number will be provided in the Shipping Confirmation and Order History screens so you can track the progress of your shipment.</p>
              <p>Please visit usps.com for more details on service levels, parcel size, policies for delays and lost packages, contact information, and more.</p>
              <p>Please Note: USPS First Class shipments are not eligible for shipping insurance. Your Priority Mail shipments, however, are insured in the same way as our other ground carriers.</p>

If you have more than one shipping address, you can select the one you need for your order from the “Shipping Address” drop-down menu</p>
              <h4>What if I have more than one shipping address?</h4>
            <p>You can add more than one shipping address. Simply select “Add New Shipping Address” in the “Shipping Address” section at the top-left of the page. Fill in the form and click “Submit.” Your new shipping address will save to your account for future orders.</p>
              <h4>Where will my order ship from?</h4>
            <p>You can see which warehouse your products will ship from on the final “Order Summary” page during checkout. Simply look under “Delivery Information” for warehouse location. Please keep in mind that different products may ship from different warehouses.</p>
              <h4>What is factored into shipping costs?</h4>
            <p>Shipping costs will vary, depending on your order and the shipping options you select at checkout. Now you can best meet your budget by shopping and comparing shipping options in the “Shipping & Billing” page during checkout.</p>
              <h4>How can I track my order?</h4>
            <p>After your order ships, you will receive an email with shipping details and tracking information if available.</p>
              <p>If you need help with email confirmations, reach out to us on Chat, call us at 1-800-786-1876, or use our contact form.</p>
              <h4>What is Trivantage’s return policy?</h4>
            <p>Most returns are honored up to 60 days from the invoice date. See our Return Policy for more information regarding our return policy.</p>
              <h4>Does Trivantage have a preferred carrier?</h4>
            <p>Our preferred carrier is UPS but you can also choose FedEx, USPS, Spee-Dee, or LTL/Truck at checkout. Compare costs between carriers at checkout to find the best price for you. You can also set your own personal default carrier.</p>
              <h4>When should I ship USPS?</h4>
            <p>While UPS is Trivantage's preferred carrier, we offer a range of shipping options to best fit our customer needs, including USPS.</p>
              <p>USPS is often a less expensive option (however, delivery can take longer than other ground carriers). If you're looking for a lower price on a shipment that you don't need right away, USPS is a great choice.</p>
              <p>Depending on your order, you can choose from the following service levels:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Priority Mail Express: next day (if order is placed prior to carrier pickup)</li>
                 <li>Priority Mail: 2–4 business days</li>
                 <li>First Class Mail: 1–5 business days in the continental U.S. (packages weighing up to 13 oz.)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you select USPS, an estimated delivery date will be shown at checkout. As with UPS, a tracking number will be provided in the Shipping Confirmation and Order History screens so you can track the progress of your shipment.</p>
              <p>Please visit usps.com for more details on service levels, parcel size, policies for delays and lost packages, contact information, and more.</p>
              <p>Please Note: USPS First Class shipments are not eligible for shipping insurance. Your Priority Mail shipments, however, are insured in the same way as our other ground carriers.</p>
